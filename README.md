This is a project made on the Tizen Hackathon in Russia, Moscow on
29-30 March, 2014.

The code is quite slow and dirty (it was written on the hackathon!),
don't take it seriously.

There are screenshots available in the `screenshots` directory of this
repository.

Also there are pebuilt binary packages (both for the emulator and device)
available in the `packages` directory of this repository.

Please note that debug build includes the Box2D debug renderer and it
is very slow. Use the release build instead.
